# BUS TRACKER PROJECT
Description:
This project is to create an app that tracks the positions of the busses on Route #1 in Boston, Mass. in real-time, so to speak.
It takes feeds from the MBTA and updates via API.
It not only shows bus icons, but has the bus number applied as well.
The red icons indicate movement in the southern direction. A blue icon indicates teh bus is moving north.

# RUNNING THE APP
One would simply copy this entire repository, then drop the file index.html into a web browser.

# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
1. To relocate labels above the icon for clarity
2. Add more routes to the map.
